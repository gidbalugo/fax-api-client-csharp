Monopond Fax API C# Client

###Overview:

* This is a C# soap web serice client for monopond web serivces.
* This client was tested in Microsoft Visual C# 2010. If you encountered problems using the client, consult with your account manager.
* Provides concrete classes that you can use to map values to requests and read responses.
* To gain access to the system you must have a Monopond user account that is flagged with Fax API privileges. 

###Basic Usage:

To use Monopond SOAP C# Client, start by adding a reference to `monopondSOAPClient.cs`. To do this right click your project in the Solution Explorer, click on `Add > Existing Item > monopondSOAPClient.cs`. Then, add another reference to System.Web.Services, to do this, right click on the Solution Explorer, click on `add reference > .NET tab > System.Web.Services` then click OK.   

In the project folder, a file called `Program.cs` is provided to show you several examples of how to use the requests.

#Building A Request

Create a new instance of the ApiService. This service needs a WSDL, your username and your password. We have two environments for the wsdl, so choose one that is appropriate for you: 

Test WSDL: https://test.api.monopond.com/fax/soap/v2.1/?wsdl

Production WSDL: https://api.monopond.com/fax/soap/v2.1/?wsdl


```C#
//Define WSDL URLs
static String PRODUCTION_URL = "https://api.monopond.com/fax/soap/v2.1/";
static String TEST_URL = "https://test.api.monopond.com/fax/soap/v2.1/";

// TODO: change user credentials
string username = "username";
string password = "password";

// Monopond Fax API Production URL
//ApiService apiClient = new ApiService(PRODUCTION_URL, username, password);

// Monopond Fax API Test URL
ApiService apiClient = new ApiService(TEST_URL, username, password);
```

#SendFax
###Description
This is the core function in the API allowing you to send faxes on the platform. 

Your specific faxing requirements will dictate which send request type below should be used. The two common use cases would be the sending of a single fax document to one destination and the sending of a single fax document to multiple destinations.

###Sending a single fax:
To send a fax to a single destination a request similar to the following example can be used:

```C#
         private static void sendFaxSample(ApiService apiClient)
        {
            // create a new fax document.
            apiFaxDocument apiFaxDocument = new apiFaxDocument();
            apiFaxDocument.FileData = "VGhpcyBpcyBhIGZheA==";
            apiFaxDocument.FileName = "test.txt";

            // create an array of api fax documents.
            apiFaxDocument[] apiFaxDocuments;
            apiFaxDocuments = new apiFaxDocument[1] { apiFaxDocument };

            //create a new fax message.
            apiFaxMessage apiFaxMessage1 = new apiFaxMessage();
            apiFaxMessage1.MessageRef = "test-1-1-1";
            apiFaxMessage1.SendTo = "6011111111";
            apiFaxMessage1.SendFrom = "Test fax";
            apiFaxMessage1.Resolution = faxResolution.normal;
            apiFaxMessage1.Documents = apiFaxDocuments;

            // create an array of api fax messages.
            apiFaxMessage[] apiFaxMessages = new apiFaxMessage[1] { apiFaxMessage1 };

            //create a new instance of sendFax request.
            sendFaxRequest sendFaxRequest = new sendFaxRequest();
            sendFaxRequest.FaxMessages = apiFaxMessages;

            // call the sendFax method.
            sendFaxResponse sendFaxResponse = apiClient.SendFax(sendFaxRequest);
        }

```

###Sending multiple faxes:
To send faxes to multiple destinations a request similar to the following example can be used. Please note the addition of another “FaxMessage”:
```C#
        private static void sendFaxSample(ApiService apiClient)
        {
            // create a new fax document.
            apiFaxDocument apiFaxDocument = new apiFaxDocument();
            apiFaxDocument.FileData = "VGhpcyBpcyBhIGZheA==";
            apiFaxDocument.FileName = "test.txt";

            // create an array of api fax documents.
            apiFaxDocument[] apiFaxDocuments;
            apiFaxDocuments = new apiFaxDocument[1] { apiFaxDocument };

            //create a new fax message.
            apiFaxMessage apiFaxMessage1 = new apiFaxMessage();
            apiFaxMessage1.MessageRef = "test-1-1-1";
            apiFaxMessage1.SendTo = "6011111111";
            apiFaxMessage1.SendFrom = "Test fax";
            apiFaxMessage1.Resolution = faxResolution.normal;
            apiFaxMessage1.Documents = apiFaxDocuments;

            // create another fax message.
            apiFaxMessage apiFaxMessage2 = new apiFaxMessage();
            apiFaxMessage2.MessageRef = "test-1-1-1";
            apiFaxMessage2.SendTo = "6011111111";
            apiFaxMessage2.SendFrom = "Test fax";
            apiFaxMessage2.Resolution = faxResolution.normal;
            apiFaxMessage2.Documents = apiFaxDocuments;

            // create an array of api fax messages.
            apiFaxMessage[] apiFaxMessages = new apiFaxMessage[2] { apiFaxMessage1, apiFaxMessage2 };

            //create a new instance of sendFax request.
            sendFaxRequest sendFaxRequest = new sendFaxRequest();
            sendFaxRequest.FaxMessages = apiFaxMessages;

            // call the sendFax method.
            sendFaxResponse sendFaxResponse = apiClient.SendFax(sendFaxRequest);
        }
```
###Sending faxes to multiple destinations with the same document (broadcasting):
To send the same fax content to multiple destinations (broadcasting) a request similar to the example below can be used.

This method is recommended for broadcasting as it takes advantage of the multiple tiers in the send request. This eliminates the repeated properties out of the individual fax message elements which are instead inherited from the parent send fax request. An example below shows “SendFrom” being used for both FaxMessages. While not shown in the example below further control can be achieved over individual fax elements to override the properties set in the parent.
```C#
private static void sendFaxSample(ApiService apiClient)
        {
        
            //create a new fax document.
            apiFaxDocument apiFaxDocument = new apiFaxDocument();
            apiFaxDocument.FileData = "VGhpcyBpcyBhIGZheA==";
            apiFaxDocument.FileName = "test.txt";

            //create an array of api fax documents.
            apiFaxDocument[] apiFaxDocuments;
            apiFaxDocuments = new apiFaxDocument[1] {apiFaxDocument};

            //create a new fax message.
            apiFaxMessage apiFaxMessage1 = new apiFaxMessage();
            apiFaxMessage1.MessageRef = "test-1-1-1";
            apiFaxMessage1.SendTo = "6011111111";
           
            //create another fax message.
            apiFaxMessage apiFaxMessage2 = new apiFaxMessage();
            apiFaxMessage2.MessageRef = "test-1-1-1";
            apiFaxMessage2.SendTo = "6011111111";
            
            //create an array of api fax messages.
            apiFaxMessage[] apiFaxMessages;
            apiFaxMessages = new apiFaxMessage[2] {apiFaxMessage1, 
            apiFaxMessage2};

            //create an instance of sendFax request.
            sendFaxRequest sendFaxRequest = new sendFaxRequest();
            sendFaxRequest.FaxMessages = apiFaxMessages;
            sendFaxRequest.BroadcastRef = "Broadcast-test-1";
            sendFaxRequest.SendRef = "Send-ref-1";
            sendFaxRequest.Documents = apiFaxDocuments;
            sendFaxRequest.SendFrom = "Test Fax";
           
            //call the sendFax method.
            sendFaxResponse sendFaxResponse = apiClient.SendFax(sendFaxRequest);
        }
```

When sending multiple faxes in batch it is recommended to group them into requests of around 600 fax messages for optimal performance. If you are sending the same document to multiple destinations it is strongly advised to only attach the document once in the root of the send request rather than attaching a document for each destination.

###Sending Microsoft Documents With DocMergeData:
(This request only works in version 2.1(or higher) of the fax-api.)

This request is used to send a Microsoft document with replaceable variables or merge fields. The merge field follows the pattern ```<mf:key>```.  If your key is ```field1```, it should be typed as ```<mf:field1>``` in the document. Note that the key must be unique within the whole document. The screenshots below are examples of what the request does.

Original .doc file:

![before](https://github.com/Monopond/fax-api/raw/master/img/DocMergeData/before.png)

This is what the file looks like after the fields ```field1```,```field2``` and ```field3``` have been replaced with values ```lazy dog```, ```fat pig``` and ```fat pig```:

![stamp](https://github.com/Monopond/fax-api/raw/master/img/DocMergeData/after.png)

##### Sample Request
The example below shows ```field1``` will be replaced by the value of ```Test```.

```C#
private static void sendFaxSample_docMergeData(ApiService apiClient)
        {
            //create docMergeFields
            apiFaxDocumentDocMergeField docMergeField1 = new apiFaxDocumentDocMergeField();
            docMergeField1.Key = "field1";
            docMergeField1.Value = "lazy dog";

            apiFaxDocumentDocMergeField docMergeField2 = new apiFaxDocumentDocMergeField();
            docMergeField2.Key = "field2";
            docMergeField2.Value = "fat pig";

            apiFaxDocumentDocMergeField docMergeField3 = new apiFaxDocumentDocMergeField();
            docMergeField3.Key = "field3";
            docMergeField3.Value = "fat pig";

            apiFaxDocumentDocMergeField[] docMergeData = new apiFaxDocumentDocMergeField[3] {
                docMergeField1, docMergeField2, docMergeField3
            };

            // create a new fax document.
            apiFaxDocument apiFaxDocument = new apiFaxDocument();
            apiFaxDocument.FileData = sample_DocxFileData();
            apiFaxDocument.FileName = "test.docx";
            apiFaxDocument.DocMergeData = docMergeData;

            // create an array of api fax documents.
            apiFaxDocument[] apiFaxDocuments;
            apiFaxDocuments = new apiFaxDocument[1] { apiFaxDocument };

            //create a new fax message.
            apiFaxMessage apiFaxMessage1 = new apiFaxMessage();
            apiFaxMessage1.MessageRef = "test-1-1-1";
            apiFaxMessage1.SendTo = "6011111111";
            apiFaxMessage1.SendFrom = "Test fax";
            apiFaxMessage1.Resolution = faxResolution.normal;

            // create an array of api fax messages.
            apiFaxMessage[] apiFaxMessages = new apiFaxMessage[1] { apiFaxMessage1 };

            //create a new instance of sendFax request.
            sendFaxRequest sendFaxRequest = new sendFaxRequest();
            sendFaxRequest.FaxMessages = apiFaxMessages;
            sendFaxRequest.Documents = apiFaxDocuments;

            // call the sendFax method.
            sendFaxResponse sendFaxResponse = apiClient.SendFax(sendFaxRequest);
        }
```

###Sending Tiff and PDF files with StampMergeData:
(This request only works in version 2.1(or higher) of the fax-api.)

This request allows a PDF or TIFF file to be stamped with an image or text, based on X-Y coordinates. The x and y coordinates (0,0) starts at the top left part of the document. The screenshots below are examples of what the request does.

Original tiff file:

![before](https://github.com/Monopond/fax-api/raw/master/img/StampMergeData/image_stamp/before.png)

Sample stamp image:

![stamp](https://github.com/Monopond/fax-api/raw/master/img/StampMergeData/image_stamp/stamp.png)

This is what the tiff file looks like after stamping it with the image above:

![after](https://github.com/Monopond/fax-api/raw/master/img/StampMergeData/image_stamp/after.png) 

The same tiff file, but this time, with a text stamp:

![after](https://github.com/Monopond/fax-api/raw/master/img/StampMergeData/text_stamp/after.png) 

##### Sample Request

The example below shows a PDF that will be stamped with the text “Hello” at xCoord=“1287” and yCoord=“421”, and an image at xCoord=“283” and yCoord=“120”

```C#

            key1.xCoord = 283;
            key1.yCoord = 120;
            key1.xCoordSpecified = true;
            key1.yCoordSpecified = true;

            apiFaxDocumentStampMergeFieldImageValue imageValue = new apiFaxDocumentStampMergeFieldImageValue();
            imageValue.FileName = "stamp.png";
            imageValue.FileData = sample_StampData();
            imageValue.height = 189;
            imageValue.heightSpecified = true;
            imageValue.width = 388;
            imageValue.widthSpecified = true;

            apiFaxDocumentStampMergeField imageStamp = new apiFaxDocumentStampMergeField();

###Response
The response received from a `SendFaxRequest` matches the response you receive when calling the `FaxStatus` method call with a `send` verbosity level.

###SOAP Faults
This function will throw one of the following SOAP faults/exceptions if something went wrong:
**InvalidArgumentsException, NoMessagesFoundException, DocumentContentTypeNotFoundException, or InternalServerException.**
You can find more details on these faults [here](#section5).

##FaxStatus
###Description

This function provides you with a method of retrieving the status, details and results of fax messages sent. While this is a legitimate method of retrieving results we strongly advise that you take advantage of our callback service, which will push these fax results to you as they are completed.

When making a status request, you must provide at least a `BroadcastRef`, `SendRef` or `MessageRef`. The 
function will also accept a combination of these to further narrow the request query.
- Limiting by a `BroadcastRef` allows you to retrieve faxes contained in a group of send requests.
- Limiting by `SendRef` allows you to retrieve faxes contained in a single send request.
- Limiting by `MessageRef` allows you to retrieve a single fax message.

There are multiple levels of verbosity available in the request; these are explained in detail below.

**FaxStatusRequest Properties:**

| **Name** | **Required** | **Type** | **Description** |
|--- | --- | --- | --- | ---|
|**BroadcastRef**|  | *String* | User-defined broadcast reference. |
|**SendRef**|  | *String* | User-defined send reference. |
|**MessageRef**|  | *String* | User-defined message reference. |
|**Verbosity**|  | *String* | Verbosity String The level of detail in the status response. Please see below for a list of possible values.| |

**Verbosity Levels:**	
  
| **Value** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **brief** | Gives you an overall view of the messages. This simply shows very high-level statistics, consisting of counts of how many faxes are at each status (i.e. processing, queued,sending) and totals of the results of these faxes (success, failed, blocked). |
| **send** | send Includes the results from ***“brief”*** while also including an itemised list of each fax message in the request. |
| **details** | details Includes the results from ***“send”*** along with details of the properties used to send the fax messages. |
| **results** |Includes the results from ***“send”*** along with the sending results of the fax messages. |
| **all** | all Includes the results from both ***“details”*** and ***“results”*** along with some extra uncommon fields. |

###Sending a faxStatus Request with “brief” verbosity:

##General Properties and File Formatting
###File Encoding
All files are encoded in the Base64 encoding specified in RFC 2045 - MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions). The Base64 encoding is designed to represent arbitrary sequences of octets in a form that need not be humanly readable. A 65-character subset ([A-Za-z0-9+/=]) of US-ASCII is used, enabling 6 bits to be represented per printable character. For more information see http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045 and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64

###Dates
Dates are always passed in ISO-8601 format with time zone. For example: “2012-07-17T19:27:23+08:00”
